# Traffic Sign Detection

## Description

This project implements a traffic sign classifier using the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset. The primary goal is to build a neural network using TensorFlow that can classify images of traffic signs into one of 43 categories. The project involves working with computer vision techniques and experimenting with neural network architectures.

## Overview

The implementation consists of two key functions:
1. load_data: Processes the dataset by loading images and their corresponding labels, resizing the images to a consistent size, and preparing them for training.
2. get_model: Defines and compiles a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify the images based on the provided categories.

The project includes:
- Preprocessing the data using OpenCV to ensure all images are the same size.
- Experimentation with CNN architectures, including layers for convolution, pooling, dense connections, and dropout.
- Training and evaluation of the model to achieve high accuracy on the dataset.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```
